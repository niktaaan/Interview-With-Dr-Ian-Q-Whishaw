Maryam: You’ve just completed another year of neuroscience research dialogue classes. How does it feel to conclude each year?  Do you enjoy holding this class? 

Ian: Do I enjoy teaching grad students? I love it! Grad students are great.  Who wouldn't like it? They're young and they're smart. They're ambitious. Yeah, they're OK to hang out with! 

Maryam: What do you think is the essence behind this course? In the university course catalog, it is described as follows: “a seminar-based course focusing on research questions and conventions across disciplines, humanities, science, and social science in Neuroscience. Emphasis is placed on creating productive research dialogues within and between students, faculty, and diverse disciplinary approaches to the field”. Before I came here, I knew this was a mandatory course for graduate student, but I couldn't understand what it meant.

Ian: Well, there are two kinds of seminar people have. One is journal club seminars where students go in and present a paper and then other people ask questions. In my experience, they're terrible. The student presentations on the papers are bad because they don't know enough to analyze the paper, and the papers are probably not of a lot of interest to the other people in the class. I think that journal clubs are great for labs because everybody's got a common interest in something in a paper, but they're just terrible for interlab communications. 
I think of what skills a grad student needs? One of the most important is, you have to be able to interact with other people. The students I went to school with, I still publishing with 42 years later! You form those relationships when you're young and so, I want to encourage that. In a lot of places that I've been the labs are little empires and people don't talk to each. I think that's a bad atmosphere, and the seminar puts people  together, they become “us”. I also think there's some skills that you need, to be a scientist, and one of them is to be able to speak comfortably, and you're not born with that ability. You can do it with lots and lots of practice. The idea is to have people talk almost every class about their most interesting thing, which is themselves and their thesis. 

Maryam: Who designed the course in the first place? This is the only mandatory course for PhD students. 

Ian: I designed it. 

Maryam: How long ago? 

Ian: They always had a journal club kind of course, and the students hated it, and eventually, no one in the faculty wanted to teach it. So ASKED me to take it over and I said, well, OK, these are my demands, I demand to get rid of the grades, make it pass-fail, and it's compulsory. Every student is in the course for the entire time they're in grad studies, except their last year.

Maryam: So you stopped teaching brain and behavior when you started teaching the seminar course? 

Ian: Yeah, I dropped it. That was a good course, I liked it. It had 300 students in it. The room was packed and every day it was showtime. I didn't ask the kids to learn anything. I just said, “Come and learn about neurosciences and that brought a lot of kids into neurosciences.” They thought the brain was really interesting. 

Maryam: I've actually heard about your brain and behavior course. Students really enjoyed it. So, it would be around 7-8 years since you started teaching the seminar course, right? 

Ian: How long has it been, well, at least 10 years. 

Maryam: Have you made any changes to the course outline or your teaching style? 

Ian: Every year I get a new idea. The last time I came up with the one minute talks. Now I've got the idea of the mandatory questions, even when somebody comes in, you have to speak up to ask the question. Every year, I think of new changes. I used to have more guest speakers. They weren't interested so that didn't work very well.  

Maryam: You sometimes take notes when students are presenting. I've always been curious about what your takeaways are.

Ian: I usually write down one word and I'm trying to think when a student gives a talk, I can remember something from that talk, and usually I don't remember anything.  I think that's largely to do with you have to learn to make a presentation so that other people remember. And so yeah, I'm always looking for a student talk that I remember and then I know they kind of got it. 

Maryam: Does that happen? 

Ian: It's surprising how little I see of that.  If you go and listen to the masters and PhD students, their slides are full of colour and full of figures and they don't explain any of the figures. But once in a while a slide is simple And the student explains the slide. And you say, OK. I mean it's not that you don't learn in class, science is a lifelong learning process. If you stay in science eventually you begin to realize you have to go to the simple slide stuff. When we have speakers that are good speakers, you notice there's slides are pretty simple. There's one idea on the slide kind of thing. 

Maryam: Why do you think so many of us were stressed about giving our talks? I was wondering if it might be because English is our second language, which makes us a bit nervous. However, I've also heard from Canadian colleagues that they were also very stressed about giving talks. Why do you think that is? This seems to affect the quality of presentations. 

Ian: Well, I think It's good to be nervous. It it's telling you to be prepared. And I'm still nervous when I give a talk, especially when I give a talk at another university. I'll start preparing that talk three or four months before and every couple of weeks I'll go through the slides. This is what I want to say to that audience. So yeah, a I'm nervous for two or three months before I go and give that talk right. So I think everybody is, but I think it's also important to give lots of talks because then you learn how to handle it. You know, I'm nervous, but I I can give a talk. 

Maryam: Were there any special moments or highlights from this year's class? 

Ian: At the business competition the impression that I had after it was over is that all the students were friends and that's kind of the success of the class, right? And Hannah Scott, the judge,  said that to me, too. She said “that's amazing”. The students know each other and that's really, I think, the target of it all.  

Maryam: Yes, that's correct. We are friends now.In your lab, the board is often filled with meeting times. You supervise many independent students or those under the supervision of your colleagues. Have you always had this approachable attitude? What were your initial thoughts about being accessible to students at the beginning of your career? 

Ian: Well, you know, before COVID and before computers everybody came to work and largely because they had an electric typewriter in their office. When we got computers, we started working at home. And then after COVID came It made it acceptable to work at home. And so now people don't see each other anymore, and the students don't see their supervisors. Any student I'm working with, I gotta meet with them. I owe them at least one hour a week. And we can do the rest on Internet. We have to have some eye contact. They have to know me a little bit and I have to know them a little bit. And I think the same goes for the undergraduates. If they take an independent study course from me think I owe at least one hour to them. And so, I mean, they have to come and see me for at least 1 hour every week, and if they miss their letter grade goes down. So they are motivated to come. 

Maryam: I guess you also enjoy these kinds of collaborations, right? Many supervisors only discuss the main topics, but staying in touch with students regularly seems to work well for both of you.

Ian: Yeah, I think students are kind of like everybody else. They are in the stressful situation, and they have their problems with life and some of them have other kinds of problems, mental health problems, physical disability problems. And I think you have to know that. You should know If there's a problem. I think when you meet with a student there's a lot of things you can tell them about science, and why you do an experiment and what you're looking for. I don't give students projects where they have to do some work, I give them a project where they have to come back to me with an idea about how something works and hopefully if they come back with a good idea. It'll be a paper someday. 

Maryam: Could you please tell us about some of your ongoing projects? What are the questions driving your current research, and what are you hoping to achieve.

Ian: Well, my main project is I study hand use and right now it's visual hand coordination, and the project I'm working on right now is the idea that we use vision for two kinds of things. One is for picking things up, and the other is for orienting things. So our mouth, can take them and I'm kind of arguing that those roles are separate and so that's one kind of project. But I have a lot of other hand projects I'm playing around with. I do some work with Duke university with mice and optogenetics. I'm their hand expert in in that research and then for fun, I also write papers about my horses. 

Maryam: Yes! I have seen them on Google Scholar. Can you explain more about them? 

Ian: Well, you know, you're riding around and sometimes you just have an idea.  I probably written about 10 papers on horses now, so it has been interesting. There are lots of people who ride horses. It's huge sport, there are almost as many horses in Alberta as there are people. But there aren't that many people interested in the science of horses. So I think we need to approach horses from a scientific point of view if we're really going to understand how we use them. Horses like to sniff dung and if you let them, they'll sniff every pile of dung they come across. I use that as a test of memory. I just let them sniff something and bring them back and see how long they sniff a secont time. If they sniff it less, then they remember. It is a very simple way of studying memory. And in the latest paper with Audry Guyonnet, we found that on the same day their sniffing decreases with trials, but but next day, they have to start over,  that phenomenon called adaptive forgetting. There are very few examples of adaptive forgetting. Buts it's a matter of survival, to forget. 

Maryam: Why It's a matter of survival? 

Ian: Well, if the dung is from a competitor who could hurt you or fight with you, you need be sure. So you check?  With some friends in Illinois and also with Candice Bruke, who's in McGill we've looked at rats and mice sniffing dung and it seems to be the same rule for them. 

Maryam: Are there any recent findings or breakthroughs in neuroscience that have particularly excited you and you're following? 

Ian: Breakthroughs that I'm following? The things that people do are so amazing to me nowadays I couldn't even imagine. I couldn't imagine optogenetics, If you ever told me you could put receptors into a nerve cell and then stimulated it with light, I would’nt have believe that. You can label specific neurons in the brain or a specific neuron population. We are getting close to being able to label all the pathways out of the structure and study each one. I couldn't have imagined that being possible. See through brains or making a brain bigger, artificial intelligence, who could have imagined it all. Well, if you could, you'd be the leader of it.   

Maryam: So you cannot imagine what advancements may come in the future of neuroscience

Ian: Well. Behavior will never be hijacked. I think it's the foundation to everything. We don't really know everything we need to know about behavior, especially human behavior, a lot of it's a mystery. We have some ideas about it, so I don't think that behavior Is going to remain a central problem.  

Maryam: Have there been any topics or ideas that you were once an advocate for, but as time passed, you found them less important or irrelevant? Have you ever lost interest in or abandoned any particular areas of research? 

Ian: Yeah, I did my phD studying hippocampal Theta rhythms and behavior and in the end I was not that interested in the brain waves but I was more interested in behavior. That is why I left that area and I went to reaching, and nobody, was studied reaching. Nobody thought rats and mice could reach. They their hands paws, not hands. And so that was a nice novel field to work in and now everybody calls hands hands. 

Maryam: What made you pursue studying reaching? 

Ian: Well, I was interested in Parkinson's disease at a time that you could take neonatal cells of dopamine and noradrenaline, put them in an animal brain, and have them grow. We know Parkinson is due to the loss of dopamine cells, so the idea was to take embryonic dopamine cells put them in the brain and restore function.  Andres Bjorklund, and Steve Dunnett were doing that at Cambridge. So I went and spent a year with Dunnett. The question is, what were you going to study? I thought that if Parkinson's Disease patients have trouble reaching, let's train rats to reach. 

Maryam: You stopped studying Parkinson's specifically? 

Ian: Well, I was interested in the application to Parkinson's disease, but reaching was also useful for studying stroke. The same with autism. There's just so many diseases involving hand impairments. If you ask people what they want back, it's the use of the hands that's always first. And you can get grant money from more sources! 

Maryam: You are such a renowned scientist, holding numerous honors. what do you consider as the most honorable achievement of your career? 

Ian: What I like the most? There are lots of little things that people don't know very much about. But One idea was the food carrying. Actually, a guy called Michael Pisa at McMasters University asked me if I could suggest a good model for studying rat hoarding. So I got a big cage in which a rat had a nest at one end and would to to the other end to get food to take home. One day I started dropping things other than food in, and the rat took them too. I dropped a little nail in, and the rat went and picked it up and dropped it. So then I tried some other little things and if it was small they wouldn't carry it. So I could do psychophysics on what size foot item would carry home. And then that lets you all sorts of studies about their behavior related to the size of the food. And then lots of other things went along with food size. If they took a big piece of food home, the time to came back was proportional to the size of the food they had just eated. If you watch them after eating, they sniff around to see if there are any crumbs and that time was proportional to the size of the food. There's a theory called optimal foraging theory where you try to optimize stuff, so if you're going to optimize you need some currency and that is time. 

Maryam: Actually, in today's culture, being a workaholic is somewhat glorified. People are always busy, working on weekends, thinking that the more effort they put in, the closer they get to success. As a successful person, you don't give me the impression that you were a workaholic.

Ian: Well, I enjoy what I am doing, but I think, largely from having women in my laboratory, I found that that by coming in in the morning and leaving at 4:30 is a successful strategy. I think it's important that people have a life, and science is just a part of that life. It's not all of that life. You know, four or five hours a day for science is a lot enough.  

Maryam: And you worked like this? 

Ian: I get up pretty early in the morning and by 8:00 or 9:00 I've properly done my day's work, and then the rest of my day is free. 

Maryam: if you were in graduate school today, how would you spend your time?  

Ian: If I were in grad school again today, I probably fail. 

Maryam: Why?! 

Ian: Well, when I went to grad school with Rod Cooper, Rod Cooper always came to work at 8:30, he was always there and he never left till five. And so when you worked in his lab, you kind of had the idea you should be there. That was good for me, I was totally irresponsible

Maryam: I'm glad, I can relate to that! 

Ian: : Yeah, we don't have that model anymore. I think if you survive as a grad student in the world that we have now, you have to be good. You have to do everything on your own. 

Maryam: Reflecting on your own journey, what do you believe was primary factor contributing to your success? Was it hard work, intellect, good network? 

Ian: When I was a grad student we took examinations like the Miller analogy and the graduate record exam, to get accepted. So the big question is, do those tests actually measure your success in grad school? And the answer is they don't. The one thing that measures that it is how persistent you are. No matter how hard the problem is, if you keep working at it, it becomes simpler and simpler until when you're finished. You say well, that was easy. 

Maryam: So you were a persistent person. 

Ian: I've worked on problems for years that I just couldn't solve, but they wouldn't go away. They always bothered me and then one day, I would think I understand it now. And I I think a lot of things are like that. Brian and I wrote two books and that took a lot of persistence, because when we started writing we were terrible writers. We had no idea how to write a book. We had to learn it by doing. We wrote chapters over and over sent them to reviewers and they would say, “ this is terrible”. 

Maryam: So, there's no magic behind success.

Ian: Yeah, It doesn't matter how smart you are. Unless you work with on a problem you're not going to solve it. I ride horses and I compete and the only way to get good at it is to ride. You can take lessons, that's helpful, but to get good at it, you have to do it, and do it, and do it, and do it.  

Maryam: Could you share a bit about your personal life? Tell us about your marriage, children, and grandchildren.

Ian: I've been married for 50 years. I have two children, two sons. One of them works for Blizzard, the gaming company in San Diego. And the other one works for Electronic Arts a gaming company in Vancouver. 

Maryam: So they're both in tech. 

Ian: They don't do computing. One of them does managing and the other one does art. The youngest in Vancouver, has 2 little kids so I have 2 grand kids. 

Maryam: Seems nobody else in your family is very interested in neuroscience.

Ian: No, not really. I have a sister who is a writer. 

Maryam:  Are there any books that you would like to suggest, ones that you enjoy reading?  

Ian: Yeah. I always liked reading. I used to almost read a book a day. 

Maryam: Read a book a day? I can't believe it as well! Even while you were working full time? 

Ian: Yeah, even when I was a professor. I don't that anymore because my eyes aren't as good as they were and it's too much strain to read small print. My favorite writer, is Dostoyevsky. I read Crime and Punishment and I I just loved it. So Russian authors in general, I like. And English poetry. 

Maryam: What about other hobbies, musical instruments, or sports? 

Ian: I played guitar in university, we had a little group played folk music. The guys I played with went on to became professional musicians.  I wasn't that good! Sports always been my hobby, it didn't matter, football, soccer, basketball, skiing, riding horses. I ride horses every day. I try not to miss a day. 

Maryam: When did you start riding horses? 

Ian: I was 60 years old. My neighbor in Fernie was selling a horse, and somehow he talked to me into buying it. It didn't know anything and nor did I, it was terrible. And then I went to a clinic by a horse whisperer who trained a horse to do some stuff in half an hour. I was totally amazed. The first insight I had that there was a way you could teach a horse.  And that got me interested in study them. 

Maryam: How many horses do you have? 

Ian: I had 10 or 12, but I only have three right now. 

Maryam: Alright! Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us!  

Ian: Ok Maryam Good Luck with all of that stuff ! Maybe you can sell that story to someone!
